# Model Card For [Model Name]
==============================

_This documentation is aimed to help communicate key information about a machine learning model. This model card has been borrowed and adapted from [Annotated Hugging Face Model Card](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-card-annotated). A model card can also be generated through [huggingface_hub library](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/model-cards) which is a python interface._
